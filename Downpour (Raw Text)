Chapter 1: Snake River
Sleepy Snake
A small frontier camp with only a few permananet residents who mostly serve the frontiersman brave enough to head into the wilderness in the northwest
A. Sleepy Snake Inn
The player characters start in the shelter of the Sleepy Snake Inn, a cabin consisting of one large room which contains a few cots in the back, a long, wooden table in the middle, and a kitchen area which is separated only by a bar.
A1. Boss Bo
Boss Bo begins by expressing his condolences over the caravan being swept away by the floods and tells how his home has also been devastated by the storms; then he offers up work aboard his ship delivering aid supplies for flood relief.  As Boss Bo is the only way around the frontier currently, the adventurers should be compelled to accept his offer.
A2. Tasha
Tasha, a stout dwarf woman, is the sole proprietor of the Sleepy Snake Inn, taking care of the cleaning, cooking, and ale.  As soon as Boss Bo finishes his conversation with the adventurers, Tasha tries to get their attention as she is worried that her cellar is flooding and needs the players to either cook the tavern's daily soup while she locks up or have the players lock up the cellar for her.
Treasure:  If the players decide to make the soup, the ymust decipher an ancient recipe, written in a forbidden script.  Passing a DC 15 Arcana or History check reveals that the recipe is written in Abyssal; likewise, a character who speaks Abyssal can identify the writing with no check.  If the adventurers can translate the recipe or pass a DC 17 Dexterity check, they each receive a helping of Sleepy Snake Stew, otherwise they receive a helping of Sleepy Snake Sludge.  If the adventurers instead choose to close the cellar, they must defeat two Water Sprites hidden as a giant puddle on the floor.  Once the cellar door is locked, Tasha will reward the players with a helping of Sleepy Snake Sludge each and 10GP total.
